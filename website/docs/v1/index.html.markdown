## Support for 1.x

While the sun rises on the `2.x` release, the sunset of the `1.x` approaches.
We intend to support minor bug fixes through the end of 2020, but we don't plan
to merge any new features into `release/1.x` branch.  Please see the section
below about upgrading the provider.  All new feature work and focus will be
directed at the newer provider version.

-> **End of support:** 2020-01-15</small>
